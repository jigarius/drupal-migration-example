# A "migration group" is as the name suggests, a group of migrations.
#
# Unlike D7, this functionality is provided by the migration_plus
# module (which in turn is required by the migrate_tools module).
# It can also be used to hold any configuration common to those migrations,
# so it doesn't have to be duplicated in each one.
#
# In this case, I have named it "c11n" - the numeronym for "customization"
# because that is the convention I usually follow for custom modules and
# other site-specific customization. I would put all custom data migrations
# in this module / migration group unless I had other reasons or modules
# to put them in.
#
# NOTE: I didn't want to use the migration_plus module or module_groups
# and wanted to do vanilla migrations using the least number of modules
# or options. However, I couldn't find any other solution but to seek
# help from the migrate_plus and migrate_tools modules as on date.

# The machine name of the group, by which it is referenced in individual
# migrations.
id: c11n

# A human-friendly label for the group.
label: Custom migrations

# More information about the group.
description: Custom data migrations.

# Short description of the type of source, e.g. "Drupal 6" or "WordPress".
source_type: CSV files

# Here we add any default settings common to the migration group.
#
# For this example, the source tables are in the Drupal (default) database,
# but usually if your source data is in a database it will be external.
# In this case we have no such common settings, so I leave this parameter
# commented out.
# shared_configuration:

# As with the migration config (see migrate_plus.migration.node_program.yml),
# we specify that this migration group depends on the c11n_migrate module.
# Hence, when the c11n_migrate module is uninstalled, this migration group
# will also be removed from the system.

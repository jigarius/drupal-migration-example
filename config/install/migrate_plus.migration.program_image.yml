# Migration file for creating "image" for academic programs.
#
# Detailed explanations for various elements of a migration
# YAML have been provided in migrate_plus.migration.program_data.yml

id: program_image
label: Image associated to academic programs.

# Source.

  # Unique ID.
  #
  # The source for images do not have any existing unique IDs. Hence,
  # we use the image name as unique IDs. This will ensure that every
  # image results in the creation of a unique file entity on the site.
  keys:
    - Image file
  # Source field definitions.
  fields:
    Image file: Name of the image file associated with the program.
  # Since we are writing YAML, we do not have ways to manipulate
  # fields like we do in PHP. However, we can use migration process
  # plugins. These plugins can use migration-specific "constants"
  # to generate file paths and URIs.
  #
  # Here, we define constants which we would use to generate file paths
  # and file names for program images.
  constants:
    file_source_uri: public://import/program
    file_dest_uri: 'public://program/image'
# Destination.
destination:
  # We will be creating entities of type "file" this time.
  plugin: 'entity:file'
# Mappings.
